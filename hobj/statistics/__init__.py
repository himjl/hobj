Benchmark 1:
- CI for the raw R^2 ceiling
- Approximate null distribution for R^2_n, given # of model simulations
- CI for overall/early/late performance
- Approximate null distribution for SpearmanR upon experimental repeat

 Scoring model:
 - R^2_n point estimate
 - Overall/early/late point estimates
 - Raw SpearmanR point estimate

Scoring heldout human split-half
- R^2_n point estimate, and CI
- Overall/early/late point estimates, and CIs
- Raw SpearmanR point estimate

Benchmark 2:
- CI for the raw R^2 ceiling
- Approximate null distribution, given the null hypothesis
- Bootstrapped standard errors for the performances

Scoring model on Benchmark 2:
- R^2_n point estimate

Scoring heldout human split-half
